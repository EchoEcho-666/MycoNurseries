            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>MycoNurseries is a non-profit promoting sustainability in fungiculture. We grow oyster mushrooms from discarded organic matter and foster an inclusive and diverse community passionate about fungi.</p>
            <p>Based on the McGill University Campus, MycoNurseries collects used coffee grounds from local coffee shops and uses them as food for the oyster mushrooms. After harvest, these mushrooms are donated to projects addressing food insecurity on campus.</p>
