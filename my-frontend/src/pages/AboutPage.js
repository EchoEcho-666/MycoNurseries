            <strong>MycoNurseries was started by Julia Wright and Daniel Cha</strong>, who wanted to make a difference in their community through their passion for fungi. Over the past two years, MycoNurseries has become a Montreal-based non-profit dedicated to promoting sustainability through fungiculture and the only organization growing mushrooms on the McGill University downtown campus.

            <strong>üå± Sustainable Substrate:</strong><br />
            We grow oyster mushrooms, and these mushrooms need ‚Äòfood‚Äô or substrate to live off of. <strong>40% of the food we give our mushrooms is coffee grounds</strong> that otherwise would‚Äôve been thrown into the landfill. So far, we‚Äôve diverted over <strong>40kg</strong> of used coffee grounds from landfills.

            <strong>üë• Community:</strong><br />
            We have over <strong>30 volunteers</strong> who help us grow the mushrooms. These volunteers are all students or young people, and through growing sessions, they learn about <strong>sustainable urban agriculture</strong>.

            <strong>üçÑ Promoting Food Security:</strong><br />
            We donate the oyster mushrooms we grow to <strong>SNAC</strong>, which provides <strong>free produce</strong> to McGill students facing food insecurity.
