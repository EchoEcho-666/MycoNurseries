        <Heading>About MycoNurseries</Heading>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>MycoNurseries was started by Julia Wright and Daniel Cha</strong>, who wanted to make a difference in their community through their passion for fungi. Over the past two years, MycoNurseries has become a Montreal-based non-profit dedicated to promoting sustainability through fungiculture and the only organization growing mushrooms on the McGill University downtown campus.

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>üå± Sustainable Substrate:</strong><br />
          We grow oyster mushrooms, and these mushrooms need ‚Äòfood‚Äô or substrate to live off of. <strong>40% of the food we give our mushrooms is coffee grounds</strong> that otherwise would‚Äôve been thrown into the landfill. So far, we‚Äôve diverted over **40kg** of used coffee grounds from landfills.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>üë• Community:</strong><br />
          We have over <strong>30 volunteers</strong> who help us grow the mushrooms. These volunteers are all students or young people, and through growing sessions, they learn about <strong>sustainable urban agriculture</strong>.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>üçÑ Promoting Food Security:</strong><br />
          We donate the oyster mushrooms we grow to <strong>SNAC</strong>, which provides **free produce** to McGill students facing food insecurity.
        </Paragraph>

        <Heading>Our Support & Future Plans</Heading>
        
        <Paragraph>
          We‚Äôve received funding from the <strong>Sustainability Projects Fund</strong>, McGill Engineering‚Äôs <strong>Global Challenges Award</strong>, and **Canada Service Corps‚Äôs Sprout Fellowship**. Currently, we‚Äôre completing the <strong>McGill Dobson Bootcamp and Cup</strong>.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Looking forward, we aim to develop an <strong>educational module</strong> on <strong>circular economies and waste management</strong> to engage the McGill and Montreal communities. <strong>Stay tuned!</strong>
